{"body":"## Introduction\r\ngack is a Go port of the ack code searching utility. It will eventually\r\nsupport the same interface as the original ack.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nI started working on `gack` when I saw a \r\n[port of ack to the C language](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher). \r\nAs I am currently working to learn Go, and the way for me to do that is to \r\nwrite as much Go as possible, I thought it would be an interesting project.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n`gack` currently supports the following flags:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        -f          list files only\r\n        -g query    list files that match the query\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Immediate TODO\r\n* support language flags to search or exclude certain languages\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n* `gack` uses the `filepath.Walk` function, which doesn't handle large\r\ndirectories well.\r\n* `gack` is currently slower than `ack`.\r\n","tagline":"A Go clone of the ack search tool.","note":"Don't delete this file!
